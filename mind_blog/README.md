## Installation


You can find the file in dist/flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl. 
Copy this file, set up a new virtualenv, then install the file with pip.

'''
$ pip install flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
'''

Pip will install your project along with its dependencies.

Since this is a different machine, you need to run init-db again to create the database in the instance folder.

$ flask --app flaskr init-db
