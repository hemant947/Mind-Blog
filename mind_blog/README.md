# Mind-Blog

Welcome to mindblog. This is a blogging website for anyone wanting to write their own blogs. You can create multiple logins for each shade of your mood and write using that shade. All moods can see each other blogpost and thus it helps you to analyse more about your thought and feelings! No comments, no likes.

Made using Flask, tested using pytest. DB is MySQL db
## Installation


You can find the file in dist/flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl. 
Copy this file, set up a new virtualenv, then install the file with pip.

'''
$ pip install flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
'''

Pip will install your project along with its dependencies.

Since this is a different machine, you need to run init-db again to create the database in the instance folder.

$ flask --app flaskr init-db
